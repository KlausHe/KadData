# Collection of utility data from the "KAD-Universe"

Link to website\
 `https://klaushe.github.io/KAD/`\

This utility collection is a es6-module file without dependencies or libraries.
It contains specific data for my website and for general purposes.

## How to get the Data in a project

1. Use as stand-alone javascript-module by importing like (recommended):\
   `import * as KadData from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KlausHe/KadData/KadData.js"`

2. Use as submodule in git to stay updated with the latest functionality (not recommended because I might upload breaking changes without documentation!)\
   `git submodule add https://github.com/KlausHe/KadData.git`
